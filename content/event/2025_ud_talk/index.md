title: Efficient Programming on Heterogeneous Accelerators 
location: "Sharp Laboratory, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, USA"
abstract: >-
In this talk, I will first discuss how new mapping solutions, i.e., composing heterogeneous accelerators within system-on-chip with both FPGAs and AI tensor cores, achieve orders of magnitude energy efficiency gains when compared to monolithic accelerator mapping designs for deep learning applications. Then, I will apply such novel mapping solutions to show how design space explorations are performed when composing heterogeneous accelerators in latency-through tradeoff analysis. I will further discuss how such mapping and scheduling can be applied to other computing systems, such as GPUs.
