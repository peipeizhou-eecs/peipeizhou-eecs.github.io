I am currently a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at Brown University, School of Engineering. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of California, Los Angeles in 2019 supervised by [Prof. Jason Cong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UVGe0gQAAAAJ&hl=en), who leads UCLA VAST (VLSI Architecture, Synthesis and Technology) Group and CDSC (The Center for Domain-Specific Computing).
My major interest is in **Customized Computer Architecture and Programming Abstraction for Applications including Healthcare, e.g., Precision Medicine and Artificial Intelligence**.
I'm honored to receive "Outstanding Recognition in Research" from UCLA Samueli School of Engineering in 2019. I have also received :trophy: 2019 TCAD Donald O. Pederson Best Paper Award :trophy: in recognition of best paper published in the IEEE Transactions on CAD in the two calendar years preceding the award. My papers have also received 2023 IGSC Best Viewpoint Paper Finalist :trophy:, 2018 IEEE/ACM ICCAD Best Paper Nominee :trophy:, 2018 IEEE ISPASS Best Paper Nominee :trophy:.

**I'm actively recruiting PhD students and research interns! Self-motivated students with relevant research and project experience (compiler, GPU and FPGA programming, artificial intelligence algorithm and application development, etc.) are highly encouraged to contact me via email**.
