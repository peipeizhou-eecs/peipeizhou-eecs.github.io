ðŸ“£ ðŸ“£ ðŸ“£ Prof. Zhou gave invited talks ["Efficient Programming on Heterogeneous Accelerators"](https://peipeizhou-eecs.github.io/talk/efficient-programming-on-heterogeneous-accelerators/) at [University of Delaware, College of Engineering, Computer & Information Sciences Seminar](https://events.udel.edu/event/cis-seminar-series-2025-peipei-zhou-phd-brown-university) and [UD Mobility](https://www.udmobility.org/home). You can watch the talk on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wo4FOTsTsM) now. 
In this talk, Prof. Zhou discussed how new mapping solutions, i.e., composing heterogeneous accelerators within system-on-chip with both FPGAs and AI tensor cores, achieve orders of magnitude energy efficiency gains when compared to monolithic accelerator mapping designs for deep learning applications. Thanks to UD CS Department Chair Prof. Weisong Shi's invitation and host!!

Prof. Zhou also had a lab tour at Prof. Shi's CAR lab, and had a ride on the Hydra platform, a level-4 Autonomous Vehicle research platform developed by the CAR lab.
