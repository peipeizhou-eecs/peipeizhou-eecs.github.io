📣 📣 📣 Prof. Zhou was invited to speak at the New York Scientific Data Summit (NYSDS) 2025, hosted by Brookhaven National Laboratory at the SUNY Global Center in New York City. This year’s theme, “Powering the Future of Science with Artificial Intelligence,” created a thoughtful setting for researchers to discuss how AI and data-intensive computing are reshaping scientific discovery. Prof. Zhou's talk, “Efficient Programming on Heterogeneous Accelerators: Architecture and Compiler Insights,” explored challenges and opportunities in harnessing GPUs, FPGAs, and specialized cores through advanced compiler design and architectural innovations. Many thanks to Dr. Yihui (Ray) Ren and Dr. Meifeng Lin for the kind invitation. It was a rewarding experience to learn from the diverse perspectives at the summit, and I came away with many new ideas and a deeper appreciation for the different ways our community is thinking about these questions.
