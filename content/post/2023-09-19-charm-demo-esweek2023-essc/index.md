My students Jinming Zhuang and Zhuoping Yang and I gave a remote demo "CHARM: Composing Heterogeneous AcceleRators for End-to-end Deep Learning Inference on Versal ACAP Architecture" on THE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS RESEARCH SOFTWARE COMPETITION (ESSC) in ESWEEK 2023. 
Thanks to the ESSC Chairs Ganapati Bhat and Biresh Kumar Joardar, ESWEEK 2023 Chairs X. Sharon Hu and Alain Girault for offering this great opportunity for us to showcase the open-source system software and artifacts and enrich open-source tools for the EDA community! In this demo, we show how to use CHARM, our [open-source tool](https://github.com/arc-research-lab/CHARM) to compile deep learning inference on AMD Versal ACAP architecture (AI ASIC + FPGA + CPU). This repo has received 76 stars since we released it in Feb. 

You are welcome to check our paper for this demo:
