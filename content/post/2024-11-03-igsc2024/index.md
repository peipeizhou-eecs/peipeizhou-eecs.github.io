📣 📣 📣 Thrilled and deeply honored to share that our work 'Amortizing Embodied Carbon Across Generations' has been accepted by the 15th IEEE International Green and Sustainable Computing Conference (IGSC'24) and won the award of Best Viewpoint Paper! 

🔍 Challenge: trade-off between embodied carbon and operational carbon costs.  
📌 Baseline approach 1: keep using existing devices 👉 0 additional embodied carbon✅, High operational carbon❌ 
📌 Baseline approach 2: update to new devices 👉 more embodied carbon❌, Reduced operational carbon✅

💡 Solution: We propose the ECO-FPGA system. By leveraging the chiplet technologies, ECO-FPGA can keep different generations of chiplets and gradually add newer chiplets. Our case study shows that ECO-FPGA can reduce the overall carbon cost of chips!
