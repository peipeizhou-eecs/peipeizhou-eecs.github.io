Prof. Peipei Zhou gave an invited talk in IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI, ISVLSI 2024, Knoxville, Tennessee, on 07/03/2024 about SCARIF framework and paper "[SCARIF: Towards Carbon Modeling of Cloud Servers with Accelerators](https://peipeizhou-eecs.github.io/publication/2024_isvlsi_scarif/)". SCARIF is a tool to estimate the embodied carbon emissions of data center servers with accelerator hardware (GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs, etc.) .

You are welcome to check the [SCARIF page](https://peipeizhou-eecs.github.io/publication/2024_isvlsi_scarif/) for the paper, open-source code, slides presentations and SCARIF tool usage demo video! My student Shixin Ji has made an excellent demo to show how to use SCARIF in Python in a single-line command.
